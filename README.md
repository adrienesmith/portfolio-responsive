# portfolio-responsive

My portfolio built using a responsive layout for the Thinkful software engineering program.

Built using HTML and CSS, this single-page website utilizes flexbox to dynamically adjust the layout based on the device the user is viewing the site on.

This site is the 2nd portfolio assignment from Thinkful. The first is located here: https://github.com/adrienesmith/portfolio

From the initial portfolio assignment to this one, my expanded CSS skills now allow for flexible layouts using flexbox CSS rules.

This website currently only contains placeholders for my projects, but will be updated upon completion of Thinkful capstone projects.
